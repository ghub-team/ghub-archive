## Versions
Here you can find the source code of all past versions of GDPS Hub with some info about them:

### 1.0
Development started on September 2020, this is the very first version of GDPS Hub ever made true, when by then it finally stopped being just a dream or prototype, and a real almost-functioning website.

It lacked of a PHP system, so JerosGamer89, who by then developed the website (still unknowing Blazen already started such a similar Discord server), was the one who uploaded and wrote manually the info of all GDPS. Until he then realized it was so slow and dev-dependant. Then, Intelligent Cat (now ToppLe) joined the project to develop a PHP system, but giving up just three months after then, without anything done and loosing the interest in the project.

### 2.0
LBlazen joined the project somewhere around November/December 2020. Jeros and Blazen had to remake the website, as Jeros was still in constant learning of HTML and CSS, being each version better as time passed, but viceversa too, meaning each version being a total shit and disaster as you go back on time. This one started of a template with a really cool lateral menu, which would be the only cool CSS thing to ever be made on that version. However, real progress was made, and they realised the project could really be made true and distributed. That's when advertising started.

### 2.1
Just an improved version of the previous, but nothing really to say about this. It began to have some real PHP functioning code in it, which was overwhelming at that point.

### 3.0
Yes, another rework done on the website, around March/April 2020. Clean and start from scratch again. This time the website really looked good, though it also took twice the time the previous version took to be developed. Furthermore, GFX and branding and advertising of the project began to be successful, some original logotypes and banners made their first appearance on what it would be GDPS Hub's true visual identity, the jumping download cube, inspired on RobTop's Geometry Dash logotype.
Visuals on the website were more developer-friendly, consistent and closer to what they look in the actual version.

### 4.0
This version was a try of reworking some CSS code of the website, resulting in a failed attempt after almost every component from the website was broken when modified or totally washed. It took place on June 2021, entering the summer. The website was quite good, but not perfect, and Jeros still had some motivation to rework and do from scratch the website for the fifth time (LOL). Although, on this version a lot of PHP and SQL code was made, being the future base for the PHP system of the website.

### 5.0
Starting its development on November 2021 and finishing on June 2022, it's the actual and standing version nowadays, and by some statements told by Jeros, this will be the last version to be made from scratch: "If we ever need to made this from scratch back again, I'll definitely leave the project and give up, it'll be a heartbreak, but some productive time on which I would have learnt a lot of things.". It's now all or nothing. The website now really looks very proffesional, and by reusing and modifying the past 4.0 PHP code, it started to really work and look like a real worked website. On from now, only time will tell!
